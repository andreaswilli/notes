*A.* We use the formula with $alpha = 3/5$ and $k = 150/100 = 3/2$.

$
  S & = 1 / ((1 - 3/5) + 3/5 dot 2/3) \
    & = 1 / (2/5 + 2/5)               \
    & = 5/4                           \
    & = 1.25 times                    \
$

*B.* We use the formula and work our way back:

$
  5/3 & = 1 / ((1 - 3/5) + 3/(5k)) \
  3/5 & = 2/5 + 3/(5k)             \
  1/5 & = 3/(5k)                   \
    1 & = 3/k                      \
    k & = 3                        \
$

So the drive through Montana needs a speedup of $3 times$ which is $300$ km/hr.

==

Use the formula with $alpha = 4/5$ and $S = 2$ and solve for $k$.

$
             2 & = 1 / ((1 - 4/5) + 4/(5k)) \
  2/5 + 8/(5k) & = 1                        \
        8/(5k) & = 3/5                      \
           1/k & = 3/8                      \
             k & = 8/3                      \

Equation 2.5 can be used to solve the previous problem. Since $omega=4$, we need

$-8 + 16 = 8$ and $-1 + 16 = 15$. Positive numbers (and zero) stay the same.

`fun1` keeps only the least significant byte and sets the other three to all
zeroes, resulting in a value between 0 and 255. `fun2` also extracts the least
significant byte, but it performs sign extension instead of zero extension,

We can use the equations to verify these results. For example, in hex F
truncates to 7, in unsigned $B 2 U_4(1111) mod 2^3 = 7$ and in two's complement
$U 2 T_3(B 2 U_4(1111) mod 2^3) = -1$.

==

Because `length` is unsigned the expression $0 - 1$ evaluates to UMax. The
comparison has an unsigned integer on one side, which means the other side will
also be treated as unsigned. Of course every unsigned number is $<=$ UMax and so
we try to access invalid array elements.

We can fix it by changing the condition to `i < length` or changing `length` to
a signed integer.

==

*A.* The function returns wrong results in case `t` is longer than `s`.

*B.* The problem is that `strlen` returns a `size_t` which is unsigned. When
calculating `strlen(s) - strlen(t)` where `t` is longer than `s` unsigned
arithmetic is used, resulting in a number close to UMax instead of a negative
number. This is obviously greater than 0 so the function incorrectly says that
`s` is longer.

*C.* We can fix it by changing the condition to `strlen(s) > strlen(t)`.

==

$"sum" - x$ can overflow again, since it's another two's complement addition.
For example, if $x$ and $y$ are large positive numbers whose sum overflows to a
negative number, then $"sum" - x$ will cause a negative overflow "wrapping back
around" to $y$. So this check will not detect the overflow.

==

The function will be incorrect for $y = "TMin"_omega$. This is because the two's
complement representation is not symmetric. $-y = -"TMin"_omega = "TMin"_omega$
causes an overflow possibly resulting in an incorrect return value.

*1.* Let $t = u + p_(omega-1)$ where $u$ is the two's complement number
represented by the $omega$ upper bits of the $2 omega$-bit representation of
$x dot y$. Since $p_(omega-1)$ is either 0 or 1, there are two possibilities for
$t$ to equal 0.

+ If $p_(omega-1) = 0$ then it must be that $u = 0$ (upper $omega$ bits are all
  0s).
+ If $p_(omega-1) = 1$ then it must be that $u = -1$ (upper $omega$ bits are all
  1s).

So $t = 0$ if the upper $omega+1$ bits are all 0s or all 1s. These are exactly
the cases where the multiplication does not overflow. All other cases do
overflow.

This means we can write $x dot y = p + t 2^omega$ which overflows iff $t != 0$.

*2.* To show that $p$ can be written in the form $p = x dot q + r$, where
$|r| < |q|$ we consider integer division. Dividing $p$ by nonzero $x$ gives a
quotiont $q$ and remainder $r$, such that $|r| < |q|$.

*3.* By plugging in we get $x dot y = x dot q + r + t 2^omega$. If
$r + t 2^omega = 0$ then $q = y$. Since $|r| < |q| < 2^omega$ this can only hold
if $r = t = 0$.

==

```c
/* Determine whether arguments can be multiplied without overflow */
int tmult_ok(int x, int y) {
  int64_t prod = ((int64_t)x) * y;
  int64_t upper = prod >> 31;
  // if the upper 33 bits are all 1s or 0s the number fits into 32 bits
  return upper == 0 || upper == -1;
}
```

==

*A.* The new code does not improve the situation since the 64-bit number will be
truncated to 32 bits when passed to `malloc`. This truncation is the same that
also happens when the multiplication overflows.

*B.* Check the multiplication for overflow (by one of the previous methods) and
if it overflows immediately abort and don't allocate any memory.

A single #smallcaps([lea]) instruction can compute the following multiples:

#table(
  columns: 3,
  table.header($k$, $b$, $(a<<k)+b$),
  [0], [0], [$(2^0+0)a = 1a$],
  [0], [a], [$(2^0+1)a = 2a$],

  [3], [0], [$(2^3+0)a = 8a$],
  [3], [a], [$(2^3+1)a = 9a$],
)

==

In this case the expression simplifies to $-(x<<m)$. This is because shifting by
$n+1=omega$ to the left results in 0 so we can ignore the first term.

Consider two cases:
- $m>0$: In this case form A requires $n-m+1$ shifts and $n-m$ additions while
  form B requires 2 shifts and 1 subtraction. So if $n=m$, form A is favorable
  since it requires only 1 shift and 0 additions which is less than the constant
  numbers required for form B. If $n=m+1$, form A takes 2 shifts and 1 addition,
  so either form is equally efficient in this case. If $n>m+1$ form A takes
  $n-m+1>2$ shifts and $n-m>1$ additions so form B is favorable in this case.
- $m=0$: In this case the last bit does not cause a shift so form A requires $n$
  shifts and $n$ additions, while form B takes 1 shift and 1 subtraction. The
  same three cases apply in the same way here, so the above analysis extends to
  this case as well.

$x$ is shifted to the left by 5 which is equivalent to multiplying by $2^5=32$.
Then, one $x$ is subtracted from it, so we end up with $31x$ and $M=31$.

If $y$ is negative, a bias of $7=8-1$ is added. Then $y$ is shifted right
arithmetically by 3 which is equivalent to dividing by $2^3=8$. This means that
$N=8$.

*A.* `false` for $x = -2^31$ which is `INT32_MIN`. $x$ is obviously not greater
than 0, and $x-1$ overflows to `INT32_MAX` which is not lower than 0.

*B.* Always `true`. The expressions are connected by `OR` so both parts would
need to evaluate to 0. Let $x_2$ be $x$'s third bit from the right. For the
first part to evaluate to 0 we need $x_2=1$. For the second part, $x_2$ will
become the sign so it needs to be 0 to represent a positive number. This is
obviously not possible at the same time so at least one part always evaluates to
$1$.

*C.* `false` for $x = 2^16-1$.

*D.* Always `true`. For all negative numbers the first part of the expression
evaluates to 1. For 0 the second part evaluates to 1. Every positive number can
be negated and still fits into a 32-bit integer so in this case also the second
parts evaluates to 1.

*E.* `false` for $x = -2^31$ which is `INT32_MIN`. It's not greater than 0 and
negating it causes an overflow (`-INT32_MIN = INT32_MIN`) which is still lower
than 0.

*F.* Always `true`. Addition works the same on the bit level for both unsigned
and two's complement numbers. Since the right side is unsigned, C will interpret
both sides as unsigned numbers for the comparison.

*G.* Always `true`. `~y` is equal to $-y-1$. Also, on the bit level `uy * ux` is
the same as `x * y`. Plugging in we get $x(-y-1) + x y = -x y - x + x y = -x$.

$3'510'593$ in binary is 11 0101 1001 0001 0100 0001 which equals
$1.101011001000101000001 times 2^21$. So the biased exponent is
$21 + 2^7 - 1 = 148$.

The complete single-precision floating-point representation is:

0 10010100 10101100100010100000100 or 0x4A564504

*A.* Always `true`. `double` has enough range to represent all `int` values and
it does not need to round. This also means no rounding when casting back.

*B.* `false` for $2^24+1$. It is not true for all numbers with $24$ or more
significant bits, since `float` uses $23$ bits for representing the fraction,
which means these values get rounded and lose precision.

*C.* `false` for $2^24+1$. The same reasoning as above applies here.

*D.* Always `true`. `double` has enough range and precision to exactly represent
any `float`.

*E.* Always `true`. Negating the `float` only flips the sign bit and loses no
information. So flipping it back results in the original value.

*F.* Always `true`. The integers get converted to `float` first.

*G.* Always `true`. If the multiplication overflows it results in
$infinity > 0$.

*H.* `false` for $f = 10^20$ and $d = 1.0$. All values are promoted to `double`
but even then the precision is not enough to represent $10^20 + 1.0$. This is
because $log_2 10^20 > 66$ and `double` has only `52` bits for representing the
fraction. So when we set the least significant bit to 1 we would need about `66`
bits to store the precise number. This means that adding `1.0` will have no
effect on the very large number.
