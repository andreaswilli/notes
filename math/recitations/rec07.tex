  \question A Protocol for College Admission
  \begin{solution}

    Each day:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Morning: Each student visits their favorite university that is not
        crossed off on their list.

      \item Afternoon: University $u_i$ tells their $n_i$ favorite applicants
        "maybe, come back tomorrow" and rejects all the other applicants of today.

      \item Evening: Every student that got rejected today crosses this
        university off their list.
    \end{itemize}

    Termination condition: On the day every university $u_i$ has at most $n_i$
    applicants, we stop.
  \end{solution}

  \begin{parts}
    \part Show that the algorithm terminates after $NM+1$ days.
    \begin{solution}
      Proof by contradiction. Assume the algorithm does not terminate after
      $NM+1$ days. On any day the algorithm does not terminate, there is at
      least one university that has more applicants than available spots
      (termination condition). Thus at least one student gets rejected and at
      least one university gets crossed off a list. After $NM+1$ days at least
      $NM+1$ universities have been crossed off. However, this is a
      contradiction since there is a total of $NM$ universities on lists. So
      the algorithm has to terminate on day $NM+1$ or earlier. $\blacksquare$
    \end{solution}

    \part Show the following: If during some day a university $u_j$ has at
          least $n_j$ applicants, then when the algorithm terminates it accepts
          exactly $n_j$ students.
    \begin{solution}
      On the day that $u_j$ has at least $n_j$ applicants it keeps its $n_j$
      favorites around. These get only rejected if a preferred student applies
      on a later day. Each applicant that has not been rejected will still want
      to join $u_j$ on the next day. Thus, on the next day $u_j$ still has at
      least $n_j$ applicants and the number of applicants can never go below
      $n_j$ at this point. On the day the algorithm terminates, the university
      can have at most $n_j$ students. Thus, on termination it must have
      exactly $n_j$ applicants. $\blacksquare$
    \end{solution}

    \part Show that every student is assigned to one university.
